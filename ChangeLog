summary:     Initial commit

2004-09-06:
use clearenv if HAVE_CLEARENV is defined.  default for glibc compiles.

2004-07-16:
it's unnecessary to conditionalize free on a structure that does
not itself contain pointers.  the implied changes were performed on sched.c
and config.c.

ncron now uses darcs for revision control.

2004-06-26:
signal flag variables are now static volatile sig_atomic_t rather than
static volatile int.

2004-03-06:

ncron is now intelligent enough to automatically compensate for constraint
changes for extant jobs.  This change means that users need not clear
exectime data in ncron's history file for edited jobs.

2004-03-05:

"-Wall -pedantic" are now default flags in builds.
Minor code cleanups to satisfy "-Wall -pedantic".

ncron now has friendly man pages.

version is now 0.98

2004-03-04:

Constrainer is now more intelligent about selecting intervals, and should
always pick the most optimal runtime.

Constrainer now understands that the number of days in a month varies as a
function of the month and year.

Constrainer should be faster and generally more correct.

Config parser now drops a job onto the dead list if initial constraint fails.

2004-03-02:

Minor code cleanups.

Add "runat" and "journal" keywords.

Improved ncron so that exectime and number of runs for expired jobs will
be saved.  However, this comes at a cost -- ncron will keep data structures
for jobs that have expired in memory.  This problem may be fixed by either
dividing the current history file into two files (preferred) or alternatively,
by having ncron edit the user configuration file to delete expired jobs (bad!).
For now, I don't consider it to be a big issue.

Make nstrl.c idempotent.

Added "maxruns" keyword.  In order to support this functionality properly,
number of job runs is now recorded along with execution times.

2004-02-26:

Initial constraint for jobs without prior exectime data does not first
add interval before constraining.

2004-02-25:

Multiple constraints of the same type are now allowed; they are implicitly
OR'ed together.

Discontinuous constraints should be more reliable.
Lots of internal improvements.

waitpid with WNOHANG never returns EINTR.

Makefile fixes

I have "ported" ncron so that it can be cleanly built on OS X.  I have no idea
whether or not it will actually work properly, since I do not own any OS X
machines.

ncron now uses the daemon() syscall rather than homebrew fork code.  This
change may introduce portability issues.

Version is now 0.95.

2003-09-27:

No more repository -- paranoid security fears about the existing ones.
(In reality, my local repo was claimed by a deathstar crash.)

Did an audit for fun:
Minor code cleanup in config.c.
Unchecked malloc() in exec.c fixed.

Added native support to chroot spawned jobs.  This change is only useful
if ncron is being run uid root.
